            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Misinformation is considered one of the major challenges of our time, resulting in numerous efforts against it.  Fact-checking, the task of assessing whether a claim is true or false, is considered a key in reducing its impact. In the first part of this talk, I will present our recent and ongoing work on automating this task using natural language processing, moving beyond simply classifying claims as true or false in the following aspects: incorporating tabular information, neurosymbolic inference, and using a search engine as a source of evidence. In the second part of this talk, I will present an alternative approach to combating misinformation via dialogue agents, and present results on how internet users engage in constructive disagreements and problem-solving deliberation.</p>
            <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Prof. Andreas Vlachos is a Professor of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge. He is a well-known NLP researcher working on several areas of NLP and ML, such as dialogue modelling, automated fact-checking, imitation learning, semantic parsing, natural language generation and summarization, language modelling, information extraction, active learning, clustering, biomedical text mining, etc. His research is supported by various agencies, such as ERC, EPSRC, ESRC, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Huawei. </p>
